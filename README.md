## Gymstats

This is a capstone project for CPSC 491
This application is my take on a beginner friendly fitness tracker.
This project was developed in python, using flask, sqlite, javascript, html, and css.

How to run the code:

1. Open a terminal at the file location \Fitness-App

2. run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. run `pip install Werkzeug==2.3.7`
(Werkzeug might cause some issues as flask no longer supports it)
4.  run the main.py file
